            <h1><a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a></h1>
            <p>
            From <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Wikipedia</a>:
            </p>
            <p>
            The <a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a> rating system is a method for
            calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such
            as chess and Go. It is named after its creator Arpad <a
            href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a>, a Hungarian-born American physics
            professor.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a> system was invented as an
            improved chess rating system, but today it is also used in many other
            games. It is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a
            number of computer games, and has been adapted to team sports including
            association football, American college football and basketball, and Major
            League Baseball.
            </p>
            <h2>Links</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://iain.github.com/elo/doc">API documentation</a>
            
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://github.com/iain/elo">Source Code</a>
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
            You need to have at least to players that can play a game (duh).
            </p>
            <pre>bob  = Elo::Player.new&#x000A;jane = Elo::Player.new(:rating =&gt; 1500)</pre>
            <p>
            Once you have players, you can register games in a variaty of ways. There
            is more than one way to do it, choose whatever works from your other code:
            </p>
            <pre>game1 = bob.wins_from(jane)&#x000A;game2 = bob.loses_from(jane)&#x000A;game3 = bob.plays_draw(jane)&#x000A;&#x000A;game4 = bob.versus(jane)&#x000A;game4.winner = jane&#x000A;&#x000A;game5 = bob.versus(jane)&#x000A;game5.loser = jane&#x000A;&#x000A;game6 = bob.versus(jane)&#x000A;game6.draw&#x000A;&#x000A;game7 = bob.versus(jane)&#x000A;game7.result = 1 # result is in perspective of bob, so bob wins</pre>
            <p>
            You can get all kinds of info from a player:
            </p>
            <pre>bob.rating&#x000A;bob.pro?&#x000A;bob.starter?&#x000A;bob.pro_rating?&#x000A;bob.games_played&#x000A;bob.games</pre>
            <p>
            Or get a list of players:
            </p>
            <pre>Elo::Player.all</pre>
            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
            You can configure <a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a> in many ways. In
            it&#8217;s default configuration, it is configured in the same way as the
            <a href="http://www.fide.com/">FIDE</a> (World Chess Foundation).
            </p>
            <p>
            Altering settings to your liking is very easy and very flexible. You can
            even specify your own K-factor rules. Have a look at the Rdoc in the code
            for a complete reference.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here is an example:
            </p>
            <pre>Elo.configure do |config|&#x000A;&#x000A;  # Every player starts with a rating of 1000&#x000A;  config.default_rating = 1000&#x000A;&#x000A;  # A player is considered a pro, when he/she has more than 2400 points&#x000A;  config.pro_rating_boundry = 2400&#x000A;&#x000A;  # A player is considered a new, when he/she has played less than 30 games&#x000A;  config.starter_boundry = 30&#x000A;&#x000A;end</pre>
            <h2>About the K-factor</h2>
            <p>
            The <a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a> rating system knows a variable
            called the &#8220;K-factor&#8221;. The K-factor is used to reward new
            talent and stableize the rating once a player is participating longer.
            </p>
            <p>
            FIDE (the World Chess Foundation), gives players with less than 30 played
            games a K-factor of 25. Normal players get a K-factor of 15 and pro&#8217;s
            get a K-factor of 10. Once you reach a pro status, you&#8217;re K-factor
            never changes, even if your rating drops.
            </p>
            <p>
            You need to provide <a href="../classes/Elo.html">Elo</a> the amount of
            games played, their rating and their pro-status.
            </p>
            <pre>bob = Elo::Player.new(:games_played =&gt; 29, :rating =&gt; 2300, :pro =&gt; true)</pre>
            <p>
            You can define your own K-factors by adding K-factor rules. This code will
            change the K-factor to 12, for every player who&#8217;s name starts with a
            B, and 16 for everybody else.
            </p>
            <pre>Elo.configure do |config|&#x000A;  config.k_factor(12) { name =~ /^b/i }&#x000A;  config.default_k_factor = 16&#x000A;  config.use_FIDE_settings = false&#x000A;end</pre>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <pre>gem install elo</pre>
            <h2>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Fork the project.
            
            </li>
            <li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.
            
            </li>
            <li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8217;t break it in a future
            version unintentionally.
            
            </li>
            <li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to
            have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself
            I can ignore when I pull)
            
            </li>
            <li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
            
            </li>
